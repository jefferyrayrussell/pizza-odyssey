Week 2 Project
A local pizza store owner with six branch locations needs information for her
business planning; specifically she needs to know how many pizzas she sells per
week for her publicity page and she needs to know the number of pizza delivery
drivers she needs for each hour of business at each location.

Each of the six branches is open identical hours 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Tuesday
through Sunday.  Randomly generated data will be used to determine for each hour
of the work week at each location: the number of pizzas sold and the number of
deliveries made.  It is assumed that a driver can deliver 3 pizzas per hour.
The pizza store owner wants the data page for each location to include the work
hour of the day, the number of pizzas sold, the number of deliveries made, and
the number of delivery drivers recommended.

Week 2 Project

A local pizza store owner with six branch locations needs information for her
business planning; specifically she needs to know how many pizzas she sells per
week for her publicity page and she needs to know the number of pizza delivery
drivers required for each hour of business at each location.

Each of the six branches is open identical hours 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Tuesday
through Sunday.  The number of pizzas sold and the number of deliveries made at
each branch location are created through a randomly generated number function
whose parameters have been normed by the owners market analysis.  It is assumed
that a driver can deliver 3 pizzas per hour.

The pizza store owner wants a separate data page for each location to include
for every work hour of the day: the number of pizzas sold, the number of
deliveries, and the number of delivery drivers recommended.

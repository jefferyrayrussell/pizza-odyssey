Week 2 Project - Pizza Odyssey - Pizza 3001

A local pizza store owner is expanding to six branch locations throughout the
city of Seattle.  She needs help in gathering and organizing the business data
she requires to profitably manage her business.  Specifically the owner needs
to know how many pizzas she sells per week for her publicity page; most
importantly she needs to determine the necessary number of pizza delivery
drivers she must staff at each location during the hours the pizza branches are
open.

Here are the facts.  Each of the six branches is open identical hours: 18 hours
per day between,8 a.m. and  2 a.m., six days per week, Tuesday through Sunday.  
Some critical data she needs purchasing supplies and staffing needs are the
the number of pizzas sold and the numbers of deliveries mad during each hour of
work for each branch location.  These arrays of numbers will be created through
a randomly generated number function whose parameters have been normed by the
owner's market analysis.  The owner assumes that a driver can deliver 3 pizzas
per hour.

The pizza store owner requests a separate data page for each location.  Each
page should include for every work hour of the day: the number of pizzas sold,
the number of deliveries, and the number of delivery drivers recommended.
